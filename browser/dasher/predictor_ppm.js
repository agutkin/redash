Have a good evening. Are you going to join us for lunch?
OK to make changes, change out original. This looks fine. See you next week.
Thanks I needed that today! I'm looking forward to the long weekend! I like it.
Nice weather for it. Hi. How is it going? I better go. Hope all is well.
Best of luck and stay in touch. Just got this. Things are OK. Are you there?
Please coordinate with him. I think I'm OK. Nothing from Mom. I'm still here.
See you soon. See you later. Will you come get me? I am on my way. hi rob.
I'm going to sleep. Still waiting on decision. Are you sure? I am all over it.
Will follow up today. Nothing but good news everyday. please call. agreed.
I want to thank everyone involved. Hey, how are you doing? Sorry about that!
Can you help me here? Can we meet? Are you feeling better? i am trying again.
I will be back Friday. and how would i be going for work. sounds good to me
and how would i be going for work? i have a favor to ask. best of luck and
stay in touch. yes I am here actually. love got it I better go. I'll confirm
nine three six five nine seven three nine zero five two one for your information
I'm fine. will call later to explain. today has been hard for me
I'm glad she likes her tree. Can I meet with you at 4:00? Next time ask Jim to
call me. Is it far? Will you come get me? I am getting lots of questions.
OK thanks. These are big storms and traffic isn't moving. What's up? I'm still
here. Thanks anyway. Not at this time. Will it be delivered? Sounds right.
